## Start Frameworks and Benchmarks

### Start Framework Server

To run any framework you need:

1. Go to the framework directory. For example: ```cd aiohttp```

2. Start the server using a script: ```bash start.sh```

_To stop the server script is used:_ ```bash stop.sh```

### Start Benchmark

The **[wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)** library is used for benchmarking. Benchmarks ran with the following parameters

* Threads = 12 (total number of threads to use)
* Connections = 400 (total number of HTTP connections to keep open with each thread handling N = connections/threads)
* Duration = 30s (duration of the test)

To run the benchmark for current framework you should run the command:

```wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080/db```
